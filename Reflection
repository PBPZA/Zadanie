I fetch the data from the website using the formula for 30 days, let's consider that it doesn't take info from weekends, still it gives 30 last available entries. I create numpy arrays and from them I create the 2 other currency pairs - 'EUR/USD' and 'CHF/USD' - this lets me use elementwise based array operations. I create a pandas dataframe of the data with Date as an index to know from which date the measurements are from. I round the dataframe values to 4 decimal places to keep consistency between all the measurements and to simplify the procedure used to overwrite the file with all currencies with only new entries. I created 3 functions that do the more optional functionality that requires user input - they ask user for an input to choose which currency pairs to access, choose to save to the csv or to do a data analysis. All of them ask user for the input from predefined options and user can choose just those options or quit. Repetitions are ignored with changing to a set and then to a list - this changes the order of pairs compared to the order given by the user, but I don't find that a problem. If we had many more currency pairs to choose from we should change this to require user to for example give use text files with currency pairs they are interested in, but given we at most have 5 pairs it doesn't seem necessary here. I use command line arguments for user to be able to choose which function requiring user input to run, this makes it easy to make the script run daily at a specific hour - just use cronjob for Linux or Task Scheduler for Windows and run it without any command line arguments. Overall the script could be made to run faster but given how little is happening here I don't think it's worth it to spend any time on optimizing the performance of the code.
